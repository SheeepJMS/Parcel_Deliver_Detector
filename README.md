# Parcel_Deliver_Detector


For this project, we need:
• An Arduino Uno
• An Ethernet shield 
• A Cat-5 Ethernet cable
• A power adaptor/wall wart/battery pack
• A force-sensing resistor (pressure sensor)
• Wires
• A breadboard
• A 10K ohm resistor
• Your Raspberry Pi control device
• Waterproof casing
• A bin or box to place parcels in


Run the Arduino sketch to check whether the forced-based resistor 
has enough pressure on it and then triggering an HTTP request.
